![City Bike Rental Project-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/781ceda3-b50a-4a4d-aec3-1b11499122c9)

**Overview:**
I analyzed 15,329,730 bike ride records across 21 columns using Google Drive for storage and Google Colab for Python-based data cleaning and analysis.
Due to the large dataset size, I focused on rides between December 31, 2024, and May 31, 2025 to ensure performance and depth of analysis.

This project focus on analyzing customer behavior. I looked at patterns across time, location, and user type.

**Key Questions:**
1. Which month had the most bike rides?
2. Which day of the week is the busiest for rides?
3. What time of day do most rides happen?
4. Do weekdays vs. weekends show different usage patterns?
5. How has usage changed over the year (month/seasonal trend)
6. What percentage of rides come from members vs. casual users?
7. Do members ride more consistently throughout the week than casual users?
8. What are the top 10 most used start stations?
9. Are there specific stations more popular with members vs. casual users?
10. What is the average trip duration by bike type?

**Tools Used:**
**Python:** pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
